## Suggestions 

### **My Suggestions**
-  Authentication to restrict access to contact downloads.
- Improve contact-saving validation to ensure the "Contact Saved" status only appears after a successful save action by the user.
- I'm not sure if it just from this assesment but I believe having a clearly defined AC would help determine what is an issue versus a misunderstanding of expectations

### **Exploratory Testing**

- Whenever I do exploratory testing, I try thinking like a real user= without the happy path knowledge that we as internal user may have, removing assumptions, and looking for gaps that may be missed. Starting with a goal or objective, but moving mainly from a curios point of view, looking at edge cases, error handling, and security risks.
