# Postman Notes
---

## **API**
### **Steps Taken:**
1. Used Postman to simulate saving a contact by making API requests to Linq.
2. Captured request headers, payloads, and responses.
3. Used browser dev tools to cross-check network activity during contact-save.

## **Findings**

###  **Contact Saving Behavior**
- The request successfully retrieves a `.vcf` file, allowing the contact to be downloaded.
- Note: There is no validation step to confirm if the contact was actually saved on the device.

###  **Concerns**
#### **No Authentication Required**
- The API token is `null`, but the request still retrieves the vCard.
- This means anyone with the URL format has the ability to access and download contacts, which could be a data exposure risk if private contacts are involved.

#### **CORS & Access Control**
- `access-control-allow-origin: https://linqapp.com` ensures only Linqâ€™s domain can request the resource, but more validation should be confirmed to prevent unauthorized access.

### **Headers & Caching Behavior**
- `cache-control: private` prevents the response from being cached publicly.
- `etag` and `if-none-match` suggest caching, duplicate requests may not trigger new API responses, could affect real-time changes.
